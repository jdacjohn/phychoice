<span>Physicians Choice Management, LLC, an independent privately held company, announces opening of the a newly constructed and Medicare certified Union Springs Dialysis Center located in Rural Alabama:</span>

	<p><strong>Union Springs, Alabama</strong> known as the "Field Trial Capital of America" for its vast spaces of hunting and agriculture lands welcome Physicians Choice Dialysis to the community.  
    <br><br>
With over 60 patients in the local catchment area who have been inconvenienced by the lack of a local dialysis facility over the past few years, the residents of Union Springs, Alabama were excited and anticipating the opening of Physicians Choice Dialysis at the Open House on December 9.  "<em>Providing Care to our local Community</em>" was retorted by Bullock County Hospital Chairman of the Board, Reed Hawthorne during the ceremony.
<br><br>
The addition of this "state of the art dialysis facility" located at 112 Conecuh Avenue West in Union Springs, allows patients who currently had to travel in excess of 40 minutes to dialysis treatments, the ability to remain close to home.  This arrangement has proved beneficial to the residents of the area, the local transportation services of the area as well as the physicians who are servicing the area.  The facility offers not only hemodialysis but also peritoneal dialysis therapies allowing the patients an option which has not been available in the area in the past.
<br><br>
Montgomery Kidney Specialists a proud partner with Physicians Choice Dialysis in Union Springs oversees the "Award Winning Quality Care" which is being provided to the Union Springs patient population.  The facility was surveyed by the Alabama Department of Public Health.  It was noted that the facility has continued exemplary standards and displays the "Ritz Carlton" like atmosphere allowing patients not only excellent care but an aesthetically appealing environment. 
<br><br> 
The facility opened featuring heated and massaging chairs, flat screen televisions, state of the art Fresenius T machines, WIFI capabilities and many more amenities.  Physicians Choice Dialysis looks forward to continuing its "Award Winning" patient care model in the Union Springs area.
<br><br>
Please join us in welcoming the affilation with Bullock County Hospital, Physicians Choice Dialysis and Montgomery Kidney Specialist into Union Springs.  For more information about this expansion of care in your local area please feel free to contact the company as <strong>334-312-3761</strong> or <a href="mailto:information@phychoice.com">information@phychoice.com</a>.
