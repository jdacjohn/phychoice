	<em>Chief Clinical Officer</em>
<p><span style="color:#005d8f;">Ms. Cindy Locklear</span>, came to Physicians Choice Dialysis with more than 30 years dialysis experience. 
	Following her 1995 Graduation from Troy State University's Nursing Program Cindy spent 2 years developing her exceptional skills at Humana Hospital in their Cardiac Step-Down, ICU, and Neo Natal units.  In 1997 she accepted a position as the Facility Administrator for Gambro Healthcare where she was directly responsible for every aspect of their daily operations. In 1980, while still employed by Gambro, she returned to the college setting where she received her Business Degree from Valdosta Technical College. Gambro Healthcare recognized her excellent Business/Medical skills and later promoted Cindy to the position of Physicians Extender/Patient Educator for three prominently known Nephrologists. Cindy was directly involved with overseeing the design, staffing, and development of various kidney dialysis centers throughout the United States. In addition, she was the liaison between the facilities/doctors and the Clinical trial studies associated with all of the dialysis facilities within her region.  Cindy came to join Physicians Choice Dialysis in 2004 as our Clinical Director where she was directly involved in overseeing the daily activities of all of our dialysis facilities. Under her supervision Physicians Choice Dialysis won the Overall Outcome Award from Network 8, Award of Excellence from Baxter, Excellence in Anemia Award, and the Star Award from Network 8.  Her excellent ability to maintain and open new facilities deficiency free was quickly recognized and she was promoted to the position of Chief Clinical Officer where she continues to oversee several of our dialysis facilities as she works directly with our CEO in many facets of implementing new business promotions, acquisitions, and mergers.   </td>
