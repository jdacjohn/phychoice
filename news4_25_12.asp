<span><strong>Physicians Choice Dialysis affiliates with The Board of Regent University of Oklahoma Medical Center and area Nephrologists to provide access to care in Bristow, Oklahoma</strong></span>

	<p><strong>Physicians Choice Dialysis</strong>, an independently private owned company, proudly announces its affiliation with The Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma in Bristow, Oklahoma and surrounding areas to provide dialysis services to the local population.  Bristow a rural area is designated as a "Medically Underserved community" which has a dire need for a dialysis facility and related services.
Recognized by both Physicians Choice Dialysis and the University of Oklahoma Department of Nephrology as well as area nephrologists, the brand new state of the art dialysis facility located at 402 South Main Street in the heart of Bristow has been Medicare Certified and now open for patient adminission.  Many patients who reside in Bristow have to travel hours to receive the life sustaining dialysis care needed as a result of their renal disease.  This travel places a tremendous burden on the patient as well as their support system.
Patients who may be interested in receiving care in this newly constructed, state of the art dialysis facility may contact our corporate office for information regarding available treatment times.
<blockquote>
"<em>We are proud to have such vibrant community support and to be able to bring to this patient population access to care in Bristow and the surrounding area.  The Bristow catchment area had no access to Peritoneal Dialysis, no access to Home Hemodialysis and no access to Hemodialysis.  We are extremely pleased to bring service to this patient population; and to be affiliated with the University and its Oklahoma City Nephrology Department and five independent renowned nephrologists who will be bringing a proven record of the highest clinic awards.  This new center, the University and our physician group is a testament to the type of quality, patient oriented relationships we are in search of with all of our relationships.</em>"  
<br>
- Thomas J. Karl, CEO, stated.
