	<p>-Thomas J. Karl, CEO</p></span>
	
	<p><span style="color:#005d8f;">Physicians Choice Dialysis</span> is a physician focused operation that actively seeks to partner with physicians 
	who want to expand their dialysis presence, have never been afforded 
	the opportunity to share in the ownership of dialysis centers, or are 
	frustrated by the lack of clinical quality that their patients are currently 
	experiencing from existing providers.</p>

	<p>Our company recognizes that each investment opportunity is unique, 
	and as such we work with the physicians to build a business structure 
	that meets the needs of the physicians.</p>
	
	<p style="color:#005d8f;font-size: 16px;">Our Partners Include:</p>

<ul class="partnerships">
<li><span>Nephrologists who participate in ownership and decision making</span></li>	
<li><span>Local medical directors assisting in the design of clinical policies</span></li>	
<li><span>Local and regional hospitals who partner in achieving quality 
	outcomes</span></li>	
	
</ul>

	<p style="color:#005d8f; font-size: 16px;">Potential Arrangements Include:</p>

<ul class="partnerships">
<li><span>Physicians interested in exploring new center opportunities</span></li>	
<li><span>Physicians looking to participate in ownership but are currently 
unable</span></li>	
<li><span>Frustrated medical directors currently tied to "sub par" dialysis 
companies</span></li>	
<li><span>Physicians focused on patient care while leaving management to us</span></li>
